## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ or any modern runtime (Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers)
- ESM environment (OpenLink is ESM-only)

## TypeScript

OpenLink is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions. No additional `@types` package is needed.

```typescript
import { preview, type PreviewResult } from "openlink"

const data: PreviewResult = await preview("https://example.com")
```
